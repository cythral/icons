# Cythral Icons
A simple icon font using SVG images that was inspired by [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.com).  The font includes several icons that are used across my projects in place of Font Awesome, where applicable.  Icons are added as needed and frequently revised, if you want to edit my current ones or contribute new ones, please feel free to open a pull request!
